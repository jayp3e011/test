The position or condition of a student with regards to the result of mock examination, may it be passed, failed, or conditional.  Initially, a student or reviewee is considered to have passed the examination if he/she obtained a general average of 75% or more with no grade lower than 65% in any given subject. Failed means a student or reviewee obtained a general average of less than 75% even if he/she has no grade lower than 65%. Conditional means a student or reviewee obtained a general average of 75% having majority of his/her subjects has a rating of at least 75% and the remaining subjects obtained a rating of lower than 65%. This means that the conditioned examinee shall re-take all the subjects under which he/she was conditioned or subjects having a grade below 65%. In order for the conditional student to be considered passed, the overall or general rating should be at least 75% and the re-taken subjects must not fall below 65%.These initial standards may be changed by the administrator or teacher depending on their discretion or decision.
